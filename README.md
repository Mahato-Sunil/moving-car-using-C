# Moving-car-using-C
It is a simple demo of the use of the graphics program. The program simply shows the use of various graphics functions to create a awesome animation of  a moving car. 
* In this program the <graphics.h> header file is used to detect and carry out the graphics operations. Since the <graphics.h> header file is already depreciated and is no longer used in the modern compiler, so it will not run in the modern compilers. 
* Inorder to run the graphics program, other supporting libraries should be downloaded and some settings has to be changed in compiler. 
* The above program is created and run in the Dev C++ compiler after the necessary configuration. 
* You can run the program in the Turbo C++ which is a very old compiler. Note that the path of the graphics should be changed to the folder where the graphics is located. Normally, the  File is stored in C:\\TC\BGI unless the installation is done in any other folder.
